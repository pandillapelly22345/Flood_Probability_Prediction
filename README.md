This project aims to develop a reliable machine learning-based flood prediction model. By analyzing various factors like rainfall, soil moisture, river flow, and climate conditions, the model aims to provide early flood warnings. This will help reduce the impact of floods on vulnerable communities, improve disaster preparedness, and aid in better resource management.
